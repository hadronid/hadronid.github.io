This August, we are thrilled to participate in the prestigious International Symposium organized by the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences at the University of Indonesia (UI). The symposium we're attending is known as ISCPMS, short for International Symposium of Current Progress in Mathematics and Sciences. Interestingly, this symposium is also part of the AUA (Asian University Alliance), an initiative aimed at promoting collaboration among universities across Asia, with this particular symposium being held in collaboration with the University of Malaysia.

Although ISCPMS is held annually, this 9th edition is truly special as it takes place on the beautiful island of Bali. The venue is the Patra Bali Hotel, which is strategically located near Ngurah Rai Airport, making it easily accessible to participants from around the world.

We are proud to see the participation of attendees from various prestigious institutions such as the University of Indonesia (UI), Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB), Sampoerna University, University of Malaysia (UM), and many others. The presence of participants from diverse academic and cultural backgrounds provides an extraordinary opportunity to share knowledge and experiences.

The event features several distinguished keynote speakers from various fields, including chemistry, biology, physics, and mathematics, offering participants profound insights into the recent developments in various branches of natural sciences.

In addition to the keynote speakers, there are also engaging parallel sessions. Parallel sessions focusing on theoretical physics, particularly Parallel Sessions 3B and 4B, are the focal points for experts in this field. Although the number of participants interested in these topics may not be as high, their enthusiasm is remarkable. They discuss various aspects related to the structure and reactions of hadrons and their roles in neutron stars. These discussions open the door to a deeper understanding of the fundamental matter of our universe and initiate collaborations among researchers. Moreover, the symposium serves as a valuable platform for educating students to engage in international arenas.

Overall, we feel grateful to participate in this exchange of ideas and knowledge that is truly inspiring. Furthermore, the exotic location in Bali adds a special element to this experience. We are confident that the collaboration among universities and scientific research we engage in will continue to bring significant benefits for the advancement of science and better lives in the future.
