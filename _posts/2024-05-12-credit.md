Behind every published work lies a tapestry of collaboration, woven together by countless contributors who bring a piece of the puzzle to life. The Contributor Roles Taxonomy, better known as CRediT, has ignited a revolution in the world of academic writing, aiming to honor every individual involved in the creation of scholarly works. By reducing disputes over authorship roles, enhancing collaboration, and ensuring proper recognition, CRediT opens a new chapter in the acknowledgment of diverse contributions in scientific publications.

#### **The Genesis of CRediT** 
The story of CRediT begins in 2012 with a pivotal workshop initiated by Harvard University and the Wellcome Trust. This collaborative effort brought together researchers, members of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), and leading publishers like Elsevier, represented by Cell Press. The goal? To create a fair and comprehensive framework that would recognize the diverse roles individuals play in the writing process, ensuring that every contribution is valued.

- **More Than Just Authors** \
CRediT goes beyond the traditional recognition of primary authors. It acknowledges the essential roles of all contributors, from researchers who formulate initial ideas to editors who refine every sentence, graphic designers who create compelling visuals, and translators who bring the work to a global audience. Every individual involved in bringing the manuscript to life is a vital part of the story.

- **Inclusive and Fair Recognition** \
While CRediT does not replace traditional authorship, it complements it by offering a more inclusive approach. This system ensures that all efforts receive the recognition they deserve through clear and well-defined terminology that covers essential roles like conceptualization, methodology, validation, and formal analysis. It provides a transparent way to acknowledge the contributions of every individual involved in the research and writing process.

- **CRediT in Practice** \
Today, the CRediT statement is a standard part of the scientific publication process. Authors, when submitting their work, also include a CRediT statement detailing the specific roles of each contributor. This allows readers and fellow researchers to understand who played a part in the creation of the work, providing transparency and proper attribution.

- **A New Era of Collaboration** \
In an age where interdisciplinary collaboration is becoming increasingly crucial, CRediT guides us toward a more inclusive and fair approach to recognizing individual contributions in academic writing. It is a significant step forward in ensuring that the story behind scientific research, like the narrative behind every piece of art, is fully respected and acknowledged.

#### Author Contributions Explained

To better understand the roles recognized by CRediT, here is a breakdown of the various contributions that can be acknowledged:

| **Term**                  | **Definition**                                                                                         |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Conceptualization**      | Ideas; formulation or evolution of overarching research goals and aims                                |
| **Methodology**            | Development or design of methodology; creation of models                                               |
| **Software**               | Programming, software development; designing computer programs; implementation of code                 |
| **Validation**             | Verification of results/experiments, ensuring replicability and reproducibility                        |
| **Formal Analysis**        | Application of statistical, mathematical, or computational techniques to analyze data                  |
| **Investigation**          | Conducting research, performing experiments, or collecting data                                        |
| **Resources**              | Provision of study materials, instruments, or other analysis tools                                     |
| **Data Curation**          | Management and maintenance of research data, ensuring it is annotated, clean, and preserved            |
| **Writing - Original Draft** | Preparation and creation of the initial manuscript                                                     |
| **Writing - Review & Editing** | Critical review, commentary, and revision of the manuscript, including both pre- and post-publication stages |
| **Visualization**          | Preparation and creation of data visualizations and presentations                                      |
| **Supervision**            | Oversight and leadership of the research activity, including mentorship                                |
| **Project Administration** | Management and coordination of the research project                                                    |
| **Funding Acquisition**    | Securing financial support for the research project                                                    |

**Example of a CRediT Statement:**
- *Agus*: Conceptualization. *Budi*: Original Draft. *Citra*: Supervision.
- *Doni*: Formal Analysis, Original Draft. *Eko*: Visualization, Supervision. *Fiko*: Funding Acquisition.

By embracing the CRediT taxonomy, the academic world is taking a significant step toward a future where every contributor's effort is recognized, fostering an environment of transparency, fairness, and collaboration.


#### Simplified Contributor Acknowledgment System

If you are looking for a simplified alternative to traditional author credit, consider the following streamlined system. 
This approach still acknowledges the contributions of all involved parties but in a more straightforward manner.

- **1. Lead Authors**
   - **Primary Researcher**: Responsible for the main research idea, design, and execution.
   - **Main Contributor**: Contributed significantly to research implementation and manuscript preparation.
- **2. Key Collaborators**
   - **Conceptual Contributor**: Provided key ideas and insights that shaped the research.
   - **Data Analyst**: Assisted in analyzing data and interpreting results.
- **3. Research Assistants**
   - **Technical Support**: Conducted experiments, performed calculations, and supported data collection.
   - **Student Helper**: Contributed to specific tasks and parts of the research under guidance.
- **4. Supervisors**
   - **Principal Supervisor**: Oversaw the project, provided guidance, and secured funding.
   - **Co-Supervisor**: Offered additional advice, support, and contributed to the project’s direction.
- **5. Advisors**
   - **Subject Expert**: Provided expert advice and feedback on specific aspects of the research.
   - **Editorial Consultant**: Assisted with manuscript editing and provided feedback on the writing.

**Example of Contributor Acknowledgment**

- **Lead Authors**: *Alice Johnson* – Primary Researcher; *Bob Smith* – Main Contributor
- **Key Collaborators**: *Carol Davis* – Conceptual Contributor; *David Brown* – Data Analyst
- **Research Assistants**: *Emily White* – Technical Support; *Frank Green* – Student Helper
- **Supervisors**: *Grace Lee* – Principal Supervisor; *Hannah Wright* – Co-Supervisor
