#### Overview

The workshop is intended to explore recent progress in understanding the quark structure of hadrons, addressing topics such as hadron reactions, structures, interactions, and their modifications in the nuclear medium. We welcome researchers from diverse backgrounds, encompassing experiments, theory, phenomenology, and lattice studies, to join us in these discussions. Furthermore, the workshop aims to cultivate communication and collaboration among young students and researchers within the Asia-Pacific region, providing a platform for networking and sharing knowledge. Through this effort, we aspire to deepen our understanding of hadron physics and connect researchers in the region. We invite you to be a part of this exchange of ideas and exploration of the quark structure of hadrons.
