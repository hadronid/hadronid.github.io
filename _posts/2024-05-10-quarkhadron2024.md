#### Overview
This workshop is intended to explore recent progress in understanding the quark structure of
hadrons, addressing topics such as hadron spectroscopy, reaction, structure, interaction, and
their modification in the nuclear medium. We welcome young researchers and students from
diverse backgrounds, encompassing experiments, theory, phenomenology, and lattice studies,
to join us in these discussions. Although we have arranged invited talks, we welcome contributed talks.
Non-speaker participants are also welcome to join.
