Science serves as a crucial window for humanity to explore and understand the universe, from its smallest particles to its grandest scales. In this global endeavor to uncover fundamental truths about the cosmos, the Nishina Center for Accelerator-Based Science in Japan plays a pivotal role. This esteemed center is dedicated to advancing knowledge through its four specialized divisions: the Nuclear Science and Transmutation Division, the Research Facility Development Division, the Accelerator Application Research Division, and the Subnuclear System Research Division.

### Yoshio Nishina: The Father of Nuclear Physics in Japan

Yoshio Nishina is celebrated as the father of nuclear physics in Japan. Born on December 6, 1890, in Okayama Prefecture, he was the fourth son of Arimasa Nishina and Tsune Nishina. In 1937, Dr. Nishina constructed Japan’s first cyclotron—only the second in the world—at RIKEN, laying the groundwork for nuclear and elementary particle physics research in Japan.

Dr. Nishina also played a pioneering role in applying radioisotopes to various fields, including medicine and biology. His contributions earned him the Bunka Kunsho (Order of Culture) from the Japanese government in 1946.

The Nishina laboratory at RIKEN became a renowned research hub, attracting prominent scientists such as Sin-itiro Tomonaga and Hideki Yukawa, who achieved significant breakthroughs in their respective fields. Dr. Nishina’s legacy continues to inspire and influence the future of nuclear physics and related sciences.

### Divisions at the RIKEN Nishina Center

**Nuclear Science and Transmutation Division** focuses on the fundamental properties of atomic nuclei, which are central to our understanding of matter. This division also explores nuclear transmutation, the process by which one chemical element transforms into another through nuclear reactions. Their research not only enhances basic scientific knowledge but also holds significant potential for practical applications in nuclear energy and radioactive waste management.

**Research Facility Development Division** is responsible for the design and enhancement of research facilities utilizing heavy ion accelerators at RIKEN. These facilities enable complex and essential experiments that advance material science, nuclear physics, and other fields, contributing valuable insights into the properties and behaviors of matter.

**Accelerator Application Research Division** conducts applied research using accelerators and experimental setups at RIKEN. This division explores a range of applications, including the development of new medical technologies, the production of isotopes for therapeutic use, and various other applications that impact everyday life.

**Subnuclear System Research Division** is integral to experimental studies involving elementary particles, atomic nuclei, and condensed matter. Utilizing particle beams such as protons, neutrons, and muons, this division investigates the fundamental laws of physics. It also engages in theoretical research at the RIKEN BNL Research Center in the United States and the RIKEN Office at RAL in the United Kingdom. Key labs within this division include:
1. Radioactive Isotope Physics Group
2. Nuclear Dynamics Research Group
3. Nuclear Structure Research Group
4. Superheavy Element Research Group
5. Meson Science Laboratory
6. [Few-Body Systems in Physics Laboratory](http://snp.riken.jp/news.php)
7. Cosmic Radiation Laboratory
8. Astro-Graciology Research Laboratory
9. Nuclear Many-Body Theory Laboratory
10. RHIC Physics Research Laboratory

The Nishina Center for Accelerator-Based Science is at the forefront of research aimed at answering some of the most pressing questions about the universe. By focusing on nuclear science, accelerators, and subnuclear systems, the center plays a significant role in expanding humanity’s understanding of the universe's fundamental aspects. Through collaborative efforts with researchers from around the world, the Nishina Center continues to excel in pioneering scientific research.

### Discovery of Nihonium

A notable achievement of the Nishina Center is the discovery of nihonium (Nh), element 113, which was officially recognized by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) on November 30, 2016. Nihonium, named after the Japanese word “Nihon,” meaning 'Japan' or 'land of the rising sun,' is the first element discovered in Asia to be permanently added to the periodic table.

The discovery was led by Kosuke Morita and his team at the RIKEN Nishina Center. The group first synthesized element 113 in July 2004 using RIKEN’s heavy-ion linear accelerator (RILAC) at the RI Beam Factory (RIBF). They repeated this achievement in April 2005 and August 2012. The IUPAC’s official recognition on December 31, 2015, allowed the team to name the new element, marking a significant milestone in the history of scientific discovery.
