The 20th International Conference on Hadron Spectroscopy and Structure (HADRON 2023) was held in Genoa, Italy, from June 5th to 9th, 2023. This series of conferences began in 1985 in Maryland, USA. It brings together experimentalists and theorists every two years to review the status and progress in hadron spectroscopy, structure, and related topics, as well as exchange ideas for future exploration.

The main themes of the conference include:
1. Meson Spectroscopy
2. Baryon Spectroscopy
3. Exotic Hadrons and Their Candidates
4. Hadron Decay, Production, and Interaction
5. Analysis Tools
6. QCD and Hadron Structure
7. Hadrons in Hot and Nuclear Environments
8. Hypernuclei and Kaonic Atoms
9. New Facilities
10. Hadrons and Physics Beyond the Standard Model

The conference serves as an important forum for scientists in the field of particle physics to share knowledge, latest findings, and insights into the mysterious world of hadrons. It is also an opportunity to delve deeper into topics involving subatomic particles such as mesons and baryons, as well as investigate exotic particles challenging our understanding.

With Genoa, Italy, as the host, conference participants will be able to enjoy the rich culture and beautiful scenery during the event. Additionally, they will gain a better understanding of how these particles play a role in the modern physics world, including the possibility of phenomena beyond the widely accepted Standard Model.
