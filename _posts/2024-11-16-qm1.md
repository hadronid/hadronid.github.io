Quantum mechanics is the foundation of modern physics, 
offering insights into the behavior of matter and energy at microscopic scales. 
To navigate this fascinating field, I've structured an introductory series of lectures for undergraduate students, 
focusing on key concepts and problem-solving approaches. Whether you're just starting out or brushing up, this guide can help. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of topics, recommended resources, and links to supplemental material.

#### Lectures

**Part 1: Introduction**
- Wave Function
  
**Part 2: Time-Independent Schrodinger Equation**
- Stationary states
- The infinite Square well
- The harmonic oscillator
- The free particles
- The delta function potential
- The finite square well
- The scattering matrix

**Part 3: Formalism in Quantum Mechanics**
- Linear Algebra
- Function space
- The uncertainty principle

**Part 4: Quantum Mechanics in Three Dimensions**
- Schrodinger equation in spherical coordinate
- Hydrogen atom

**Part 5: Theory of Angular Momentum**
- Angular momentum
- Spin 1/2 and electron in magnetic field
- Addition of angular momentum
