The Strangeness Nuclear Physics (SNP) School has been an annual event since its inception in 2012. 
Initially started at Tohoku University, it has moved across various prominent institutions including Osaka University, J-PARC, and RIKEN. 
The school is closely tied to experiments conducted at the J-PARC facility and RIBF RIKEN. 
Since 2018, Professor Hosaka, who is my PhD supervisor, has been one of the key organizers of the event.

The SNP School is known for inviting leading scientists from around the world to deliver lectures on the history and recent advancements in strangeness nuclear physics. 
This year, the school is scheduled to take place in Tokai-mura from December 11 to 15, 2023. 
Among the lecturers is Luca Biotti from Osaka University, who taught me quantum mechanics during my master's studies. 
While not all lectures are directly relevant to every attendee's research, this yearâ€™s topics include exotic hadrons and the electron-ion collider, 
which align closely with my field of study and promise to be particularly beneficial.

One of the unique features of the school is a dedicated session where students present their research. 
Awards are given to the best presenters, adding an element of competition and recognition. 
One of these awards is the Hashimoto Prize, named after Professor Osamu Hashimoto (1947-2012) of Tohoku University, 
who was a leading figure in strangeness nuclear physics and was slated to chair the school before his untimely passing. 
The prize honors his dedication and contributions to the field and the school.

My journey with the SNP School began in 2015 when I attended as a bachelor student at Tohoku University, coinciding with the HYP international conference. 
I have participated almost every year since then, making this my eighth consecutive year. 
This long-term involvement likely makes me one of the longest-standing participants. 
Over the years, I have had the privilege of learning from esteemed lecturers, including Professor Terry, and have seen many Indonesian students, 
including myself, benefit from the experience.

The SNP School is truly international, with participants from various countries and English as the official language. 
This setting has enriched my academic journey and provided numerous opportunities for growth and learning. 
The school has been instrumental in shaping my research career, and I cherish the memories and knowledge gained from this platform.

Looking ahead, I am hopeful that the SNP School will continue to thrive for many decades, fostering advancements in nuclear and hadron physics. 
There are plans to collaborate with the CNS School at RIKEN next year, and I am eager to participate if possible. 
The SNP School has been a cornerstone of my academic life, and I look forward to its continued success and contributions to the scientific community.
