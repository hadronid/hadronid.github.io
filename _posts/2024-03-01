Indonesia’s National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN), the country’s leading research body, 
is enhancing its global presence through key international partnerships, notably with Japan’s prestigious RIKEN Nishina Center. 
Together with the Nanotechnology and Material Research Organization (ORNM), BRIN and RIKEN successfully organized The 1st Conference on Accelerator-Based Science and Technology (CAST 2024), 
held on February 20, 2024, at the B.J. Habibie Science and Technology Research Center in Serpong. 

The event was a significant milestone, drawing 200 participants from 46 institutions across nine countries. 
CAST 2024 marked a crucial step in Indonesia’s efforts to advance in accelerator-based science and technology, 
an area where the country is striving to catch up with its regional peers.

In 2023, BRIN launched an ambitious initiative aimed at boosting the nation’s scientific and technological capabilities. 
This initiative focuses on revitalizing BRIN’s research reactors and advancing accelerator science and technology. 
These efforts are intended to position Indonesia as a more active player in global scientific progress. 
Recognizing that human resources are the cornerstone of these advancements, 
BRIN is prioritizing the development of internal and external talent through various programs.

Another important focus for BRIN is the cultivation of potential users of advanced technologies within Indonesia. 
This includes forming strategic partnerships with organizations that can help develop these users and foster collaborative efforts in areas of mutual interest.

CAST 2024 was a platform for around 50 speakers to present their research on topics including accelerator technology, nuclear science, and material science. 
The conference also featured the School on Advanced Spectroscopy for Material Sciences, where 125 final-year students 
and early-career researchers participated, aiming to nurture young talent and provide insights into BRIN’s talent management strategies. 

The four-day event, which ran from February 19 to 22, 2024, included advanced spectroscopy schools, focus group discussions, poster sessions, 
laboratory tours, public lectures from ORTN, and networking opportunities such as a welcoming and gala dinner.


The collaboration between BRIN and RIKEN highlights the vital role of international partnerships in advancing scientific research, particularly in hadron physics. 
By focusing on human resource development and fostering cooperative efforts, 
Indonesia is positioning itself to make significant contributions to this dynamic field.
