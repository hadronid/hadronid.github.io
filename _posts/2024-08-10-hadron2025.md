#### Overview

Dive deep into the heart of particle physics with our workshop, "Unveiling the Quark Structure of Hadrons." 
This immersive event offers a unique opportunity to explore the intricate world of subatomic particles, 
focusing specifically on the elusive quarks that constitute the building blocks of hadrons.

Led by leading experts in the field, this workshop provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamental 
principles underlying the quark model and its application to the study of hadrons. 
Participants will embark on a captivating journey through the history of particle physics, 
from the pioneering discoveries of quarks to the latest advancements in experimental techniques and theoretical frameworks.

Through a combination of engaging lectures, interactive discussions, and hands-on activities, 
attendees will gain a deep understanding of the quark structure of hadrons and its implications for our understanding of the universe. 
Topics covered will include:
- Introduction to the Standard Model of particle physics
- The quark model: theoretical foundations and experimental evidence
- Classification of hadrons: baryons, mesons, and exotic particles
- Experimental methods for probing the quark structure of hadrons
- Quark confinement and the nature of strong nuclear force
- Beyond the quark model: exploring new frontiers in particle physics

Whether you're a seasoned researcher, a graduate student, or simply curious about the mysteries of the subatomic world, 
this workshop offers something for everyone. Join us as we unravel the secrets of quarks and delve into the fascinating realm of hadron physics.
